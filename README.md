# InterRAG: Resume-based Interview Q&A Generator

InterRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that helps you prepare for interviews by:
- Generating tailored interview questions based on your resume (PDF)
- Generating optimal, human-like answers for each question using your resume as context

## Features

- **PDF Resume Input:** Just provide your resume as a PDF file.
- **Automatic Question Generation:** Get interview questions tailored to your experience and domain.
- **Contextual Answer Generation:** Receive realistic, concise answers (10â€“15 sentences) for each question, grounded in your resume.
- **Cerebras LLM Integration:** Uses the Cerebras Model Studio API for high-quality language generation.
